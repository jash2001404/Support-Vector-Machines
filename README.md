# Support-Vector-Machines
The code creates the soft margin SVM from it's primal and dual form from scratch using CVX.
Then, the optimal regularisation parameter is found using the primal form.
Sklearn is also used at the end to recreate a model with a similar accuracy.
All code is implemented in a single Jupyter notebook. The purpose of creating this was to understand
the underlying working of the SVM in a theoretical as well as practical way.
